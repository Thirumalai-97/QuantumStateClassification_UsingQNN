# QuantumStateClassification_UsingQNN

This work addresses a critical applied challenge in quantum information science: classifying multi-qubit (n) quantum states as entangled, separable, and into relevant sub-classes using quantum machine learning. Traditional methods rely on classical algorithms with density matrix features, often facing scalability issues. We introduce a resource-efficient, O(n)-scaling approach using a problem-inspired quantum circuit to systematically generate representative quantum states across all classes. These states are input into a quantum neural network, enabling efficient training. Our method demonstrates strong potential for scalable, hardware-efficient quantum state classification in practical quantum technologies.
